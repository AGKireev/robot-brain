This project is for a hexapod robot.
It is written in Python.
When working with the project code, please do not remove the commented code!

The main script in the project is:
main.py

== Description of servos which this robot has ==
=== Legs scheme ===
left_I -<forward>-- right_III
left_II ---<BODY>--- right_II
left_III -<Backward>- right_I

== A single leg movement ==
Servos start from default position.
For a forward movement vertical servo goes up while horizontal servo goes forward. And then vertical servo goes down while horizontal servo goes backward.

 pos=2---pos=3---pos=4

=== Legs servos (PWM 0-11) ===
Front is where the robot is facing and where the camera is.
Horizontal servos - move the leg forward and backward.
Vertical servos - move the leg up and down.

1. Left Side:

- Front Left Leg (left_I): PWM 0 (horizontal), PWM 1 (vertical)
- Middle Left Leg (left_II): PWM 2 (horizontal), PWM 3 (vertical)
- Back Left Leg (left_III): PWM 4 (horizontal), PWM 5 (vertical)

2. Right Side:

- Front Right Leg (right_III): PWM 10 (horizontal), PWM 11 (vertical)
- Middle Right Leg (right_II): PWM 8 (horizontal), PWM 9 (vertical)
- Back Right Leg (right_I): PWM 6 (horizontal), PWM 7 (vertical)

=== Camera Servos (PWM 12-13) ===

1.  PWM 12: Camera Left/Right movement
2.  PWM 13: Camera Up/Down movement

=== Unused PWMs ===
PWM 14: Not used in this code
PWM 15: Not used in this code
