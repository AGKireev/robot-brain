# IMPORTANT!
Build was tested on:
Adeept RaspClaws robot
Raspberry Pi 5 8Gb
Camera Module 3 (IMX708) -> changed from the stock one!
Python 3.11
FOR THIS SETUP YOU'll _*NEED BETTER BATTERIES*_, 2x 18650 is not sufficient!
I used: 1x 2S Lipo Battery 50C 2200mAh 7.4V Short Battery
Discharge rate matters! Or the Raspberry will halt when the motors are running at full!

-- ORIGINAL ROOT INSTRUCTIONS --
First of all, the program should be done in the SD card, including writing the Raspberry Pi system, 
downloading and installing the Rasptank program. 

Pay attention to the case sensitivity during process of git clone . The specific operation process 
is in the document and manual. It will automatically start up at boot after the program is successfully installed. 

You need to connect the driver board and the Raspberry Pi, and before turn it on, connect the servo with the driver board. 
Wait until the servo rotates to specified position to assemble. 

The servo is 20 teeth and will have an error of less than 9Â° during the installation process, which is normal.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The .py program in the folder client is the program required on the PC.
The .py program in the folder server is the program required on the robot.

This instruction focuses on the programs in the folder server. When you encounter problems, you can refer to this description to solve the problem.


1.What should I do if the robot does not automatically run the program when I turn it on?
First cause: the program is not installed completely, probably  because the server connection of the dependent libraries needed is unstable, resulting in incomplete download of the dependent libraries.The full version of the program needs to install the appropriate dependencies to run properly.
Second cause: Linux is case sensitive.The case sensitvity of the name when you clone from Github is different from the one of the autostart file of the default path. 

Solution: try the beta program - a program named serverTest.py in the folder server.
If you need the beta program to run automatically  every time you boot, execute autorun.py - enter "2" to select the autorun beta - enter.
If you need to change to the full version of the autorun program every time you boot, execute autorun.py - enter "1" to select the full version of autorun - enter.


2.What should I do if the servo is moving in the opposite direction?
Cause: the servos were produced in different batches, the moving direction of them may be different.

Solution: We have reserved an interface for adjusting the direction of the servo in the program, which makes it much more easier to debug.
All motion-related code is written in the program server/move.py.
Enter the following command to open (note that it is not to execute) move.py and edit:
	sudo  nano (path)/move.py
After opening move.py, change the value of set_direction to 0 (the default is 1), then press ctrl+x to exit, press Y to save change, and press Enter to confirm.


3. What should I do if the it fails to realize good self-stabilization?
Cause: The IPD controler is used for self-stabilization. You need to input the appropriate PID parameters to achieve perfect stabilization. The PID parameters of each robot are different.

Solution: If the reaction is slow, you can increase the P value appropriately (the line75 of move.py). If the reaction is too fast (or swing back and forth), you can reduce the P value appropriately.
If the reaction speed is normal but there is overshoot, you need to increase the I value appropriately.
The D value is differential and usually does not need to be changed for this product.
